    "- **PostgreSQL:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/) is an open-source, highly-extensible object-relational database management system known for its reliability and feature richness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AlloyDB:** [AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/overview) is Google Cloud's fully-managed, PostgreSQL-compatible database service optimized for demanding enterprise workloads and transactional/analytical hybrid processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemini:** [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) is a family of generative AI models that lets developers generate content and solve problems. These models are designed and trained to handle both text and images as input.\n",
    "  - **Gemini 1.0 Pro model (`gemini-1.0-pro`):** Designed to handle natural language tasks, multi-turn text and code chat, and code generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertex AI Embeddings for Text:** With [textembedding-gecko](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/text-embeddings) models we can easily create a text embedding with LLM. `textembedding-gecko@003` is the newest stable embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with AlloyDB backend. After installing the pre-requisites, we create an AlloyDB instance and use it to store embeddings. Finally we demonstrate how to fetch similar documents from AlloyDB and answer questions based on the documents fetched using `gemini-1.0-pro`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Text embeddings are created for publicly available abstracts from patents data and use them in our LLM search. Google Patents Research Data contains the output of much of the data analysis work used in Google Patents (patents.google.com).\n",

Ideally, (i) die air at die head end of die syringe (26), plus (ii) the air contained in the inflatable cuff (19) of die LMA (12), plus (iii) die air contained in their interconnection, is a &#34;substantially constant&#34; volume which is shared at these three locations but which is automatically shifted by piston (27) displacement, such that air pressure in the substantially constant volume is caused to correct as necessary for conformance to a predetermined level of set-point pressure. Various instrumentalities (10), including microprocessor-controlled instrumentalities, continuously monitor patterns of system response to observed pattern abnormality, with audibly and visually reported warnings to die anesthetists.\n",

      "\n",
      "This project could build upon the technology described in patent AP-1676-A to create a more sophisticated monitoring and control system for laryngeal mask airways (LMAs). This system could use sensors to monitor various aspects of the LMA, such as cuff pressure, air leakage, and patient respiration. It could then use this information to automatically adjust the cuff pressure and other settings to optimize ventilation and patient comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Transdermal Drug Delivery System for Viral and Microbial Infections:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This project could develop a transdermal drug delivery system based on the technology described in patent AP-1629-A. This system could deliver antiviral or antimicrobial drugs directly to the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system and potentially improving drug efficacy and reducing side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Improved Washable Diaper Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This project could improve upon the design of the washable diaper described in patent AP-1423-A. This could involve using new materials, improving the fit and comfort of the diaper, or adding features such as wetness indicators or antimicrobial coatings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Combination Therapies for Medical Conditions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This project could explore the use of combination therapies for various medical conditions, as suggested by patent AP-175-A. This could involve developing new drug combinations or finding new ways to deliver existing drugs in combination.\n",

      "**5. New Sulfonamide Derivatives for CNS Disorders:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This project could research and develop new sulfonamide derivatives with improved efficacy and safety for treating CNS disorders, as described in patent AP-1277-A. This could involve synthesizing new compounds, testing them in animal models, and conducting clinical trials.\n",

      "**Additional Information:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* When considering these project ideas, it is important to conduct thorough research and analysis to ensure that the proposed device is safe, effective, and meets a clear unmet need in the medical field.\n",
